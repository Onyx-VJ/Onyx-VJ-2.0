# Onyx-VJ-2.0

This is a prototype for GPU Accelerated Onyx-VJ.  This project never made the big time, as bugs in the Adobe AIR SDK was preventing releasing this to the general public.

(see bug: https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3133185)

# previous version

# stuff

This version of Onyx includes enhanced plugin support, opengl pipeline plugins, better handing for native components.  Maybe one day this project will be revived.
